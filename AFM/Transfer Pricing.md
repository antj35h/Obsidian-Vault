# Transfer Pricing
MNC supply their affiliates w/:
- Capital 
- Technology
- Managerial Skills

In return, parent receives
- dividends
- interest payments
- royalties
- license fees
At the same time, significant intra-firm transfers of goods and services occur.

For example;
Subsidiary → *raw materials* → Parent
Parent → *final goods* → Subsidiary

For these, they need to charge prices → TRANSFER PRICING
## Types
### Cost - based methods
- **Variable/marginal cost:** 
	- Selling Division → *transfer goods* → Buying Division
	- At marginal cost of production if S has spare capacity as the marginal costs reflects the true cost
- **Full Cost:**
	- Full Cost = Variable Costs + Fixed overheads and sometimes includes a mark up.
- **Dual pricing & two-part tariff systems:** 
	- Setting transfer prices at variable cost and once a year there is a transfer of a fixed fee to supplying division representing an allowance for its fixed costs.
### Market - based approach
- If supplying division is at full capacity then the revenue it loses as a result of internal transfer shows the true cost - revenue foregone - to the division of an internal transfer.
#### Advantages
- **Divisional Autonomy -** 
	- Parent can decide whether to buy from market or from Supplier
- **Corporate Profit Maximization -** 
	- Parent will buy from S; better quality of service, greater flexibility, and dependability of supply
	- S will likely sell to P; cheaper admin costs, selling and transport costs
	- Best Interests of the group as a whole
#### Disadvantages
- Market price may not be perfect - affected temp by economic conditions...
- Products may not be identical in the market
- Works better when S is at full capacity
