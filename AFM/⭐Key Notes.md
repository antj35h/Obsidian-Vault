# Initial Coin Offerings
- A cryptocurrency is a digital or virtual currency. It is difficult to counterfeit as it uses cryptography (the computerized encoding and decoding of information) for security.
- An ICO is the cryptocurrency equivalent of an IPO. A quantity of crypto is sold in the form of "tokens" to investors. These tokens are similar to shares in a company. 
- Investors → provide finance → company → invest in a new company → or start a new digital currency.
- In return, investors hope success of the project or new currency will provide them with a good return.
## Advantages
- ICOs are decentralized and largely unregulated → creates opportunity.
	- Allows access to a global market of investors when it can be often difficult to fund projects from traditional.
- No regulatory compliance requirements.
## Disadvantages
- Due to lack of regulations → ICOs - scams
# Types of Synergies
## Revenue Synergy
- Higher revenues may be due to increased volumes from sharing customer contracts and distribution networks.
- May be possible to increase prices → rebranding → increased market power
## Cost Synergy
- Reduced costs from negotiating better terms from suppliers or sharing HO functions.
- Sharing production facilities → lower costs
## Financial Synergy
- Combining two companies → improving their financial activities
# Problems w/ Acquisition
## Agency Theory
- Over dominant director seeking status may desire to maximise revenue by increasing market share as opposed to maximising profit and building shareholder wealth.
- Empire building
## Paying too much
- change in economic conditions → lead to price paid > net benefit purchase
## Culture Clash
- Failure to define a new shared culture on day one
- standoff between groups of employees
- significant impact on effectiveness of new group and morale
## Loss of talent
- Key staff may leave > face the uncertainty of change in new structure
## Customer/Supplier uncertainty
- Customers fear post-acquisition quality and delivery problems and may anticipate an increase in share price
- Failure to communicate → loss of customers
- Supply chain may fear potential liquidity issues 
- and reduce quality and credit terms
## Due Diligence Errors
- Unexpected issues
- costs and liabilities arise as the DD process failed to adequately identify:
	- all costs
	- contingencies
	- assets
	- staff skills
	- capacity
	- data, etc...
## Pre-Emptive theory
- Acquisition pursued out of fear → competitor will gain large cost savings OR synergies from horizontal integration
